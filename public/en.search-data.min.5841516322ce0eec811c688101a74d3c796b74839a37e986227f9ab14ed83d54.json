If these files are not present, youâ€™ll need to generate a new SSH key.\n2. Generate a new SSH key (if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one) # If you don\u0026rsquo;t have an SSH key, you can create one by running:\nbash\nCopy code\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \u0026quot;your_email@example.com\u0026quot;\nFollow the prompts, and it will generate a key pair (id_rsa and id_rsa.pub) in the ~/.ssh directory.\n3. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent # Run the following commands to start the ssh-agent and add your key:\nbash\nCopy code\neval \u0026quot;$(ssh-agent -s)\u0026quot; ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n4. Add your SSH key to GitHub # Now, you need to add the public key to your GitHub account:\nCopy the SSH key to your clipboard:\nbash\nCopy code\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nGo to GitHub:\nNavigate to Settings \u0026gt; SSH and GPG keys. Click New SSH Key and paste your public key there. 5. Test your SSH connection to GitHub # To confirm that GitHub is now recognizing your SSH key, run:\nbash\nCopy code\nssh -T git@github.com\nIf successful, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a message like:\nvbnet\nCopy code\nHi your_username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\n6. Try pushing again # Now, you can try pushing your changes again:\nbash\nCopy code\ngit push origin main\nThis should work without the permission error. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!\n"}]
